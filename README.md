## 🎥 Real-Time Object Detection using Webcam & Deep Learning

This project is a real-time object detection system that uses a live webcam feed to detect and label 92 different objects instantly. It demonstrates the practical use of computer vision and deep learning in real-world scenarios.

## 🔍 Overview:

The application captures live video from a webcam and processes each frame using a pre-trained object detection model. Detected objects are displayed with bounding boxes and labels in real time. The system is optimized for speed, accuracy, and low latency, making it suitable for practical applications.

## 🚀 How It Works:

1. Webcam captures live video frame S.
2. Each frame is passed to the object detection Model.
3. Model predicts object classes and locations.
4. Bounding boxes and labels are drawn on detected objects.
5. Output is displayed in real time on the screen.
6. Continuous detection until the program is stopped.
